# Code Prepared for AI Assistants

This directory contains a stripped-down version of the codebase with docstrings and 
comments removed to reduce size when sharing with AI assistants.

## Contents

- `code/`: The stripped code files
- `diagrams/`: UML and Mermaid diagrams of the code structure

## How to Use

When working with AI assistants like Claude:

1. **Share the stripped code files** from the `code/` directory instead of the original files.
   These maintain all functionality but are much smaller.

2. **Share the diagrams** to provide architectural context:
   - For Mermaid diagrams: Share the `.mmd` file contents in a code block with the "mermaid" language tag
   - For standard UML diagrams: Upload the PNG/SVG file directly

3. **Reference the original docstrings** when needed for specific implementation details.

## Size Comparison

- Original code: 13075 lines (583K)
- Stripped code: 4801 lines (387K)
- Reduction: approximately 64%
